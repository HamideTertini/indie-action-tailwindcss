                    <p class="mb-24">I've been on quite a journey since I started as a developer in 2013. After years of freelancing and working as a developer, in the past 5 years I've started exploring various methods of indie hacking and content creation. Here's a glimpse of what I've accomplished:</p>
                    <ul class="mb-24">
                        <li>Wrote articles on my <a href="#">blog</a></li>
                        <li>Grew a <a href="#">Twitter audience</a> of over 180k followers</li>
                        <li>Created a <a href="#">YouTube channel</a> (generating $50k)</li>
                        <li>Wrote an <a href="#">eBook</a> ($30k)</li>
                        <li>Co-created a <a href="#">coding course</a> ($150k)</li>
                        <li>Developed a <a href="#">SaaS product</a> ($60k)</li>
                        <li>Started multiple successful communities</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="mb-24">These experiences have taught me invaluable lessons about building products, creating content, and managing communities. Now, I'm excited to share these insights with you through the Indie Action Community.</p>
                    <p>Whether you're just starting out or looking to take your indie hacking to the next level, I believe this community can provide the support, accountability, and knowledge you need to succeed.</p>
                    <p class="mb-24">Let's build, ship, and profit together!</p>
